<a name="Introduction"></a>
<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
Doxygen is a tool for generating documentation from source code and it currently
handles many languages either natively or through add-on filters. This script
is one such filter that transforms T-SQL into C-like code so that doxygen can
then parse it natively.
</p><p>
While this means that you can benefit from the automated generation of
documentation it does mean that you have to mentally translate a 'struct' back
into a 'table' and reverse the type and member/variable names in declarations.
</p><p>
NB: There is a separate project underway that is designed to allow Doxygen to
natively handle SQL and format it in more natural fashion.
</p>

<a name="Installation"></a>
<h4>Installation</h4>

<p>
The only file you need from the package is <code>sql2doxygen.ps1</code>. Copy
it to somewhere suitable such as your Doxygen installation or the SQL project.
</p><p>
In the doxygen configuration file for your project you'll find a section about
options for input files. Near the bottom of that section you'll find an entry
called <code>INPUT_FILTER</code>, set this to where the <code>sql2doxygen.ps1</code>
script lives.
</p><pre>
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT        = .
. . .
INPUT_FILTER = "PowerShell.exe -File C:\Path\To\sql2doxygen.ps1"
. . .
</pre><p>
NB: The surrounding quotes are required or you'll get a cryptic error from
Doxygen about not being able to find it.
</p>

<a name="Exmaple"></a>
<h4>Example Output</h4>

<p>
In the package you'll find a subfolder called <code>Example</code> that contains
a Doxygen project file and a few .sql files. Assuming the Doxygen .exe is on your
path and the location is writable you can generate the example output like so:-
</p><pre>
C:\sql2doxygen\Example> doxygen.exe Doxygen.cfg
</pre><p>
You should see a new folder appear called <code>Dox</code>. Open <code>index.html</code>
to see the results.
</p><p>
NB: The example Doxygen.cfg file uses a relative path to reference the sql2doxygen
filter script and so you must ensure the current working directory (CWD) is set
to the <code>Example</code> folder.
</p>

<a name="Formatting"></a>
<h4>SQL Source Formatting</h4>

<p>
TODO... The example covers some of this in its introduction page.
